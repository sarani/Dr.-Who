					<td><p>The Seventh Doctor is the seventh incarnation of the protagonist of the long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was portrayed by the actor Sylvester McCoy.Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change. McCoy portrays the seventh such incarnation, a whimsical, thoughtful character who quickly becomes more layered, secretive and manipulative. His first companion was Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford), a computer programmer who travelled with his previous self, and who is soon succeeded by troubled teenager and explosives expert Ace (Sophie Aldred), who becomes his protégée.</p></td>
