					<td><p>The Ninth Doctor is the ninth incarnation of the protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's revival in 2005. The Doctor is a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality. Although the recent history of the character is left ambiguous in the premiere episode, a gradual backstory to the Ninth Doctor is revealed throughout the series.</p>
