					<td><p>The Fifth Doctor is the fifth incarnation of the protagonist of the long-running BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Peter Davison. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. Because he is a Time Lord, when the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change.</p></td>
